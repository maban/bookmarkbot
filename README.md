# bookmarkbot

Enter bookmarks in the command line, and have them published to a repo to share with your friends!

## Installation

Pull down the repo, navigate to the directory and run `npm install` in your command line.

## Usage

Type `npm run start` in your command line to kick off a chat with Mark the Bookmarkbot (who also happens to be a squirrel).

If you want to run a build without adding a bookmark, it's `npm run build`. To deploy, `npm run deploy`.
